# Node Server + React client = ❤

## Overview/Motivation

1. No hassle(webpack, babel etc.) => create-react-app.
1. all in one repo but separate folders and scripts.
1. Develop with single command(both server and client): npm run dev
1. Deploy as you want(client build > s3, server > herouku whatever).

## how to use

1. npm i && npm i --prefix client && npm i --prefix server
1. npm run dev
